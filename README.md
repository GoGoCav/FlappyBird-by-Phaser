This is a HTML5 version FlappyBird game, which is developed with the great framework [Phaser](http://phaser.io).

I started learning Phaser recently. It's really powerful and easy to use. Thanks [Photonstorm](http://www.photonstorm.com) to bring us such amazing work.

Thanks [Dong Nguyen](https://twitter.com/dongatory) for making FlappyBird game, I really love it!

Also I want to thank [无双](http://www.cnblogs.com/2050/p/3790279.html). I followed his tutorial to finish this game.
